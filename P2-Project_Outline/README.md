## Submission Instructions

### Overview
For my project, I plan to make a media catalog site.  For me, I have lots of books, music, movies, and games that I buy and collect regularly.  One of the problems that arise from this is that I have the potential to repurchase an item that I may have previously purchased.  I plan to help solve this problem by creating a site where a user can look at their catalog and share their catalog with other people.


### Features
User login - I believe that each user should login to preserve their list and to add or delete items as needed.  Also a login feature will be needed to prevent other users from editing that user's list.

Organizable list based on catagories.  Users can view items based on type of media, such as Books (hard cover or paperback. Physical vs. Digital media)

Exporting documents - I would like users to have the option to export their document to be readable in a word processing application i.e. Microsoft Word or Google Docs

Options for people viewing lists to order items from sites, such as Amazon.com

### Technologies

Java
SpringBoot
Gradle
MySQL
Amazon's API

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to add Amazon's API.  I want to add bootstrap to this app to make it stylistically look better than other projects I've developed.  I would also like to learn how to potentially make this a mobile application.
